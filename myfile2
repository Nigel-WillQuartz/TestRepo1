I am working as a developer
I started of as a software engineer after being a network engineer for some years
got into machine learning 
and with my automation background got into robotics. ie industrial robotics. made mad money though
also did blockchain(crypto programming/smart contracts), cyber security , full stack development
got into cloud hard. so thats is my Tech cv at age 45.
Now I have my startup which is blowing up big time in Cali and Europe.
